How to run DirSync Pro:
  In MS Windows double click on DirSyncPro.exe (or dirsyncpro.jar).
  On all other Operating Systems (such as Linux) run from the command line:
  java -jar dirsyncpro.jar

  If you want to allocate more memory to DirSyncPro, use the following
  command to run DirSync Pro with 512MB (adjust to own will):
  java -Xmx512M -jar dirsyncpro.jar

  The wrapper DirSyncPro.exe itself already uses 512MB memory. 

Requirements:
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6.0 or higher. You can download JRE at
