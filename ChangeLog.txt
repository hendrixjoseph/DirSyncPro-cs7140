  The backups are stored in a new directory structure in a new subdirectory of the destination directory named ".DirsyncBackup".
  The backup files have the original filename with "_##" appended before the extension, where "##" is the increasing number of the backup
  ("00" is the latest backup, "01" is the backup before "00" and so on).

changes since 0.9

solved bugs:
- if a log file can not be created (e.g. because of access rights) logging will be disabled 
  (global log leads to error, log of a directory definition only leads to a warning)
- if a file can not be accessed only a warning is issued (before a critical error was issued and the synchronization was halted).
- all text fields produce key events (if you enter e.g. exclude masks and change the directory definition no changes will be lost)  
- if you select a directory instead of a file as log for a directory definition a line-separator intead of a file-separator was added
  (thanks to S. Stobbe)
- file extensions are now added even if another file extension was given => all configuration files end with the default extension
  (thanks to S. Stobbe)
- fixed some NullPointerExceptions in FileTools when in console mode 
  (thanks to MikeyT)
- the global log is initialized before saving the configuration.

new features/enhancements:

  "<global>" for the path of the global log
  "<name>" for the name of the current directory definition.

   as the global log, named as the current directory definition)
- display paths in ""

- options start with "/" on windows and with "-" otherwise 
  (so an absolute path on linux will work correctly)

if you write "<time>", "<hh>", "<mm>", or "<ss>" in the filename of the destination directory or the log file this will be replaced by the current time

- "quit" waits for synchronization of current file to finish

- properties file "dirsyncpro.properties":
If the properties file "dirsyncpro.properties" exists (normally in the current directory) then it is read and the properties are added as system properties.

(useful if specified on the command line - not in the properties file it's location it sets :-).

- new property "dirsyncpro.config.path":
If this property is specified, then "Save Config" and "Load Config" use this directory.

- new property "dirsyncpro.pattern.casesensitive"
